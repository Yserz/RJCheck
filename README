== RJCheck

TODO
RJCheck checks the architecture of software.
RJCheck also can check low-level constrains like a classname-constraint (e.g. *Service).

== Install
- clone the git repo with 'git clone <git_repo_adress>'
- make sure ruby 2.0.0 is installed (you should use rvm for that)
- make sure bundler is installed as a gem
- execute 'bundle install'
- test RJCheck with 'rake test'
- run RJCheck with 'ruby lib/rjcheck'
